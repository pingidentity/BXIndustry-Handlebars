# Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

[BXIndustry](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/) is a unique demo in that it allows demonstrators to bootstrap DaVinci demonstrations! It allows demo-ers to tailor the skins to highlight a number of DaVinci flows that they have developed or will be developing. There are many different industry verticals which can be cloned and adapted to tailor to your prospect or customer for a more personalized demo in the field.

The following verticals are available in BXIndustry:

1. [Generic](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/generic) - Formerly BXGeneric
2. [Airlines](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/airline)
3. [Company](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/company)
4. [Eats](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/eats)
5. [Education](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/education)
6. [Finance](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/finance)
7. [Government](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/government)
8. [Health](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/health)
9. [Hotels](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/hotels)
10. [Insurance](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/insurance)
11. [Manufacturing](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/manufacturing)
12. [Pharmacy](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/pharmacy)
13. [Realty](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/realty)
14. [Retail](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/retail)
15. [Sports](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/sports)
16. [Volunteer](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/volunteer)

With BXIndustry, you can choose a vertical you would like to use, build your workflows and forms in DaVinci, and update the settings.json file to change page content such as text and images. HTML templates are available for different modal forms for use in DaVinci see [HTML Templates for DaVinci](#templates).

**Note: Flows are now customized in BXI via HTML data attributes for simplicity. Please see the documentation on [bxi-davinci.js](#bxi-davinci-js) for more information.**

## Standard Flows<a name="standard-flows"></a>

BXIndustry now comes standard with the Passwordless Flow pack when cloning the repo for use with widget! This includes the main Passwordless flow (which includes Registration and Login), Profile Management, Device Management, and Password Reset. The flow JSON is officially distributed through the [PingLibrary](https://library.pingidentity.com/page/collection-bx-davinci-flows) where we have a page with all of Ping Integration Directory flows that we have converted to work well with BXIndustry. Please note that there are some instructions you will need to follow in the PingLibrary pages for the flows themselves in order for them to work properly.

During registration you can choose to create a user with an email and password or create a user without a password and using the email as an MFA device.

## Cloning<a name="cloning"></a>

To clone BXIndustry, scroll to the bottom of the page on any vertical and click the **Clone BXIndustry** button. During the cloning process, you can choose to bootstrap your clone to DaVinci through Widgets or OIDC (i.e. redirect through a PingOne Application). When creating a configuring BXIndustry to use DaVinci flows via widgets, you can modify all DaVinci API values or leave them as-is to use the default settings. If you are configuring BXIndustry to use OIDC you will need to provide your own Issuer Url and Client Id since we can't account for additional domains in Redirect URIs, you can leave those fields empty and populate them in the config/bxi.json file in your project later if needed. See the [environment](#environment) section.

**Note: The clone form will pre-populate the default authentication and registration flows. These values can be modified to import your own custom flows or leave them as-is to use the default settings.**

The default vertical should be one value from the list:

- airlines
- company
- eats
- education
- finance
- generic
- government
- health
- hotels
- insurance
- manufacturing
- pharmacy
- realty
- retail
- sports
- volunteer

## PingOne Environment for Widgets<a name="ping-one">

In order to use BXIndustry with your PingOne environment, please configure you environment using the following steps:

1. Ensure you have the SSO, MFA and DaVinci services added.
2. Create a MFA connection and fill in the properties.
   - No need to change the the default login experience in PingOne, MFA is done through the DaVinci flows.
3. Import the flows you wish to use into your DaVinci instance.
   - Flows and HTML templates to help you build your own flows can be found in [Ping Library](https://library.pingidentity.com/page/collection-bx-davinci).
4. Create a new PingOne OIDC application with the Web App preset.
   - Make sure to select this new web app in any PingOne Authentication nodes in your authentication flow or the flow will throw an error when it tries to create a session.
5. Create a new DaVinci application and add flow policies for each of those flows.
   - Note the policy IDs and API Key and include them in the form when cloning the BXIndustry repository.
   - If you have already cloned BXIndustry you can update those values in the config/bxi.json file at the root of the project.

## An (IMPORTANT!!) Note on Versioning<a name="versioning-note"></a>

We recommend making as many changes in your DaVinci flows as you can. Changing the BXI source code can can be powerful for customizing your app but could result in conflicts when we release new features and bug fixes. When we release changes, if you cloned the repo with git you can run `git pull` from the root of your project to get the latest changes. If you downloaded the project zip file, you will need to re-download and port over your `config/bxi.json` file to get the latest code. Further customizations to BXI can typically be done in a small subset of files to make porting easy. See the [project structure](#project-structure) section for more details.

## Another (IMPORTANT!!) Note on CSS<a name="css-note"></a>

We recommend that you try to stick with the default templates provided in the dialog examples noted [below](#templates) when putting HTML into DaVinci. It is not recommended to import CSS libraries or do other extensive styling in DaVinci because those styles can bleed out of your flows to the entire BXIndustry site when a flow is loaded.

If you must apply custom styles please try to scope them via specific IDs (`#element-id {...}`) or classes (`.element-class {...}`) to prevent your styles from affecting your site.

Bootstrap 5.3 is now included in BXI and can be used within your flows. The default templates use bootstrap as well and should be easy to tweak as needed! See [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/) for more information on how to use bootstrap.

## Switching the Verticals<a name="verticals"></a>

Use the gear icon in the bottom right corner to open the “shortcut” page for all of the verticals. If you'd like to change the default vertical, change the `activeVertical` field in `config/bxi.json` to one of the verticals listed in [cloning](#cloning).

## BXGeneric<a name="bxgeneric"></a>

[BXGeneric](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/) is now part of BXIndustry! To create a BXG clone click **Clone BXIndustry**, and change the vertical dropdown to Generic. When Generic is chosen you will be prompted for a static policy id. This is the flow that is loaded on the page when it loads. Generic is essentially just another vertical so it is located at `<hostname>/generic`. The Log In and Sign Up buttons are the same as any other vertical in BXI.

**Note: BXGeneric does not include a dashboard page at this time, so you will not be redirected anywhere after you complete registration or log in.**

## OIDC<a name="oidc"></a>

BXIndustry now supports running DaVinci flows through a PingOne OIDC Application! This leverages our [OIDC SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pingidentity-developers-experience/ping-oidc-client-sdk) developed in-house. When cloning make sure to select the `Configure With OIDC` button after you've entered your name and prospect then enter your Issuer URL and Client ID on the following screen. You can fill in these values later in your config/bxi.json file if you don't have an application set up yet when you're progressing through the cloning flow. Technically the OIDC SDK and BXIndustry should work against any OIDC provider, but we have only tested it against PingOne at this time. You may need to modify some of the functions in the `public/register-functions.js` file to populate the username from your IDPs user-info endpoint.

Don't have a PingOne environment or OIDC application yet? See `PINGONE-MCP-SETUP.md` for how to have an AI coding agent provision one for you via the PingOne Remote MCP Server.

## Need Help?<a name="help"></a>

Feel free to reach out to the demo team via our [Slack Channel](https://grid-pingidentity.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C0A8U7XD6KV) if you need help setting up your project or flows. This is also a great place to stay up-to-date on demo releases and submit feedback for features or bugs.

# Development<a name="development"></a>

## Home Pages<a name="home-page"></a>

Each vertical has a home page located at `src/pages/<vertical>/index.hbs` which is accessed in the browser via `<hostname>/<vertical>`. The home page displays Authn flows through `src/home-nav-buttons.hbs` at the top right of the page, so button customizations can be done in that file and will propagate through all verticals.

### Simulate Login<a name="simulate-login"></a>

Out of the box, BXIndustry will will redirect a successful authentication to the dashboard page for the current vertical. It is built around the PingOne Authentication connector and will try to store ID and Access Tokens for you as well as getting the username from the ID Token to display on page headers. You can customize this in the `public/register-functions.js` file in the `defaultAuthnSuccess` function.

## Dashboard Pages<a name="dashboard-page"></a>

Each vertical (except for generic) has a dashboard page located at `src/pages/<vertical>/dashboard.hbs` which is accessed in the browser via `<hostname>/<vertical>/dashboard`. To enable the static Dashboard DaVinci flow for all verticals, `config/bxi.json` should have a value for `widget.dashboardPolicyId`, and it will be loaded on each vertical at page load. Similarly, DV Buttons are available on the dashboard page, defined by the `widget.dashboardTabs` array in `config/bxi.json` and rendered by `src/dashboard-buttons.hbs`.

The Dashboard section in the file includes the `"username"` key, which will be displayed in the dashboard page header. By default, if there is a suitable value in the ID Token received from the PingOne Authentication connector at the end of your flow it will be displayed as the username, this can be customized in the `public/register-function.js` file in `bxi.pageLoad` near the top.

### Simulate Logout<a name="simulate-logout"></a>

Currently, logout redirects the user to the current vertical home page. If you need to add any tear-down logic like clearing session data, there is now a function in public/register-functions.js called bxi.logout where you can add customizations. Be sure to add code before the `window.location.assign` call or it will be ignored.

## Project Structure<a name="project-structure"></a>

Since your customized instance of BXIndustry is run locally on your computer you will either need to start over with a fresh copy of the repository or be able to easily `git pull` changes when upgrading to a new version. With this in mind most customizations can be made in a small subset of files.

### Global Files<a name="global-files"></a>

Buttons to launch DaVinci flows are now located in `src/home-nav-buttons.hbs` and `src/dashboard-buttons.hbs` and are customized with HTML data attributes instead of through settings.json files.

- `src/home-nav-buttons.hbs` - collection of buttons displayed in the top nav of each vertical, rendered from the `widget.authnButtons` array in `config/bxi.json`
- `src/dashboard-buttons.hbs` - collection of buttons displayed in the top of the dashboard content section of each vertical, rendered from the `widget.dashboardTabs` array in `config/bxi.json`
- `public/register-functions.js` - register callback functions that can be run during various stages of application/flow execution (see [bxi-davinci.js](#bxi-davinci-js) for more information)

### Vertical Files<a name="vertical-files"></a>

Each vertical contains a handful of files in case you only need to focus on one vertical for your demo:

- `config/<vertical>.settings.json` - Simple content changes may be made in this file
- `src/pages/<vertical>/index.hbs` - root page of your vertical (e.g., `<hostname>/company`), contains home page HTML
- `src/pages/<vertical>/dashboard.hbs` - dashboard page for your vertical (e.g., `<hostname>/company/dashboard`), contains dashboard HTML
- `src/pages/<vertical>/branding.hbs` - handlebars file that contains CSS variables used for branding

#### Vertical Settings<a name="vertical-settings"></a>

Each vertical has an independent **settings.json** file.
For example:

- `config/airlines.settings.json`
- `config/education.settings.json`
- ...

Settings files provide the ability to make quick changes for vertical text and images.

`"title": "BX<vertical-name>"` - This is the project name which displays in the head of the page.

Color and other branding options are located in `branding.hbs`.

```css
    <style>
      :root {
        --bxi-primary-color: #A71E23;
        --bxi-secondary-color: #280A04;
        ...
      }
    </style>
```

BXIndustry also includes a drawer for editing. To enable this, set `"enableEditing": true` in `config/bxi.json` at the root of your project. Then you can navigate to the editable page using the pencil links on the shortcuts page. We recommend setting that flag to true only as you are making changes, then setting it back to false (especially while you're conducting a demo with a prospect) as anyone can access that drawer and make edits. The editor is limited to branding (colors and fonts) and basic content (strings and images that are not contained in an array in the settings.json). If having the ability to edit additional sections of the settings.json file through the drawer would be helpful, please let us know in the Slack channel.

### Images/Static Content<a name="images"></a>

You can add images in two ways:

- CDN URL (e.g., public URLs from existing sites)
- File name (extension included) - will be delivered from internal `public/<vertical>` folder, if you'd like to add/update images, you can add them to that folder and reference them in the associated [settings.json](#vertical-settings) file.

The `images` section includes basic pictures for the specific vertical (favicon and logo). These can also be full urls if you've uploaded images to a CDN or are using publicly available images elsewhere.

```json
  "images": {
    "favicon": "/<vertical>/favicon.ico",
    "apple_touch_icon": "/<vertical>/apple-touch-icon.png",
    "logo": "/<vertical>/logo.png",
    "dialog_logo": "/<vertical>/auth-dialog-logo.png"
  },
```

If you would like to remove an image because you have rebranded, you can just set the image property to an empty string, e.g., to remove the logo from dialogs:

```json
  "images": {
    ...
    "dialog_logo": "",
  }
```

**Note: There is now a data attribute to hide dialog logos as well! See [bxi-davinci.js](#bxi-davinci-js) documentation for more info.**

**Note: If you're [running the project locally](#installation) make sure to restart `npm start` if you add new static files, they are only picked up when the server starts.**

### HTML Templates for DaVinci<a name="templates"></a>

HTML templates are available for DaVinci flows in the `src/templates` directory.

To preview the modals, add **/dialog-examples** to the vertical url and click the button associated with the template you'd like to view.

For example:

- [/manufacturing/dialog-examples](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/manufacturing/dialog-examples)
- [/airlines/dialog-examples](https://demo.bxgeneric.org/airlines/dialog-examples)
- ...

To build out your UI's manually there is a collection of all elements used in the examples broken down in `src/templates/all-elements.hbs`. When building out your form, ensure all form elements and the submission button are wrapped in a `<form>` tag so DaVinci can pick up form submissions.

### Other Locations<a name="other-locations"></a>

Generally speaking you should not need to change files that were not previously mentioned, and shouldn't unless you know what you're doing. For information purposes, below is a quick description of other locations within BXI:

- `public/js/*` - internal BXI JavaScript resources
- `public/bxi-davinci.js` - internal JavaScript file wrapping DaVinci and bootstrapping [data-attributes](#bxi-davinci-js)
- `resources/handlebars.js` - handlebars initialization (partials, etc), used by `server.js`
- `resources/helpers.js` - helpers used by `server.js`, including building the `global` object made available in `.hbs` files from `config/bxi.json`
- `scss/*` - SCSS that is compiled into `public/styles.css`, each vertical has a `customizations.scss` file for vertical branding tweaks
- `src/partials/*` - internal handlebars partials, if you add additional partials they will be automatically picked up on server initialization, see `resources/handlebars.js` for information on partial naming

## bxi-davinci.js Documentation<a name="bxi-davinci-js"></a>

With the new version of BXI, it is easier to further customize where and how you launch flows! Default configurations are now plain HTML in the `src/home-nav-buttons.hbs` and `src/dashboard-buttons.hbs` file. These are in a centralized location so they can be used in all verticals!

**Note: It is not recommended to include company id or api key in your front-end HTML or JavaScript for security reasons. Try to keep all of your flow policies in the same DaVinci Environment and Application and set the appropriate values in `config/bxi.json`. That being said data attributes for overriding api key and company id are provided for edge cases.**

You can manually configure html elements to load flows by applying the following attributes to any element:

| Attribute                | Description                                                                                                                                           |       Default Value        |                 Required                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------: | :---------------------------------------: |
| `data-dv-flow`           | How your flow will be loaded on the page, value options are 'static' or 'modal'                                                                       |             -              |                    Yes                    |
| `data-policy-id`         | Policy ID that will be used to invoke your flow                                                                                                       |             -              | Yes (unless `data-url-policy-id` is used) |
| `data-company-id`        | Company ID that will be used to invoke your flow                                                                                                      | `widget.companyId` from config/bxi.json |
| `data-api-key`           | API Key that will be used to invoke your flow (not recommended)                                                                                       |  `widget.apiKey` from config/bxi.json   |
| `data-hide-logo`         | If "true" the vertical logo on the resulting modal will be hidden                                                                                     |          `false`           |
| `data-url-policy-id`     | If set, will look for the policy ID in a URL parameter of the same name                                                                               |             -              |
| `data-url-company-id`    | If set, will look for the company ID in a URL parameter of the same name                                                                              |             -              |
| `data-url-api-key`       | If set, will look for the api key in a URL parameter of the same name (not recommended)                                                               |             -              |
| `data-dv-param-<name>`   | These will be passed to DaVinci as parameters of the request, see more about usage below                                                              |             -              |
| `data-success-callback`  | Success callback that is called from the function registry when a flow returns a success response                                                     |             -              |
| `data-error-callback`    | Error callback that is called from the function registry when a flow returns an error response                                                        |             -              |
| `data-parameter-factory` | The return object from this function will be merged with any data-dv-param attributes and sent in the parameters property of the DaVinci flow request |             -              |

**Note: Static flows are loaded on page load, and they use the HTML element the attribute is included on as a container to display the widget. For best results, we recommend using a `<div>` element for this.**

**Note: Modal flows are loaded when the HTML element the attribute is included on is clicked. For best results, we recommend using a `<button>` element for this.**

### Additional Information on data-dv-param<a name="additional-info-params"></a>

To pass parameters in the DaVinci request that is sent when the flow is loaded, use `data-dv-param-<name>` attributes. You can use as many of these attributes as you need on an element. The parameter name that is sent to DaVinci is inferred in a couple ways. It will remove data-dv-param- and the rest of the name will be used as the parameter name in PascalCase. To customize the parameter name (e.g., as a different casing) you can do so by adding the parameter name in front of two colons before the value. See last [example](#bxi-davinci-examples) below.

### Additional Information on Callbacks<a name="additional-info-callbacks"></a>

Currently there are three places you can inject callback functions during DaVinci flow execution:

- prior to the request being send to `davinci.js` for dynamically retrieving flow parameters
- flow successCallback
- flow errorCallback

In order to use these, ensure you have registered a function in `public/register-functions.js` and that the value in `data-success-callback`, `data-error-callback` or `data-parameter-factory` on your flow trigger HTML control matches a function name in the registry. Asyncronous functions in the registry work as well!

Technically you can register a function anywhere after `initFunctionRegistery()` is called in the `bxi-davinci.js` file, however we recommend they are added to the `public/register-functions.js` file so they are in a centralized location and are easy to merge in with changes if we release new features you'd like to have.

To register a function you must provide the function with a name, you can do that using a string value and an anonymous function, or just passing a named function

```javascript
bxi.registerFunction('callbackName', () => {...}); // Anonymous function usage
bxi.registerFunction(function callbackName() {...}); // Named function usage

// Either of these usages can also be asyncronous and will be awaited when they are used
bxi.registerFunction('callbackName', async () => {...}); // Anonymous function usage
bxi.registerFunction(async function callbackName() {...}); // Named function usage
```

To use a registry function add the name of the registered function (case sensitive) to the appropriate data attribute on the HTML control

```html
<button
  data-dv-flow="modal"
  data-policy-id="xxx"
  data-success-callback="callbackName"
>
  Log In
</button>
```

When using a parameter factory function, you must return an object that will be merged with any data-dv-params present on your HTML element

**Note: The factory result will override data-dv-params if any duplicate properties are present**

```javascript
bxi.registerFunction(function loginParams() {
  return { FirstName: 'Fred', LastName: 'Tester' };
});

// HTML Usage
// <button data-dv-flow="modal" data-policy-id="xxx" data-parameter-factory="loginParams">Log In</button>
```

### Examples<a name="bxi-davinci-examples"></a>

**Simple Modal**

This example adds a login button that launches policy id xxx and uses the API Key and Company ID included in `config/bxi.json`.

```html
<button data-dv-flow="modal" data-policy-id="xxx">Log In</button>
```

**Static Widget**

This example looks for a url parameter called "profilePolicyId" (case sensitive) and uses the value as the policy id to load the flow on page load. The flow loads in this element since it's static, so position it on the page where you'd like the flow to be.

```html
<div data-dv-flow="static" data-url-policy-id="profilePolicyId"></div>

**Param Usage**

This example will result in parameters that are sent to DaVinci with the flow start request. The resulting JSON that is sent to DV is below the HTML example.

```html
<div
  data-dv-flow="modal"
  data-policy-id="xxx"
  data-dv-param-first-name="John"
  data-dv-param-last-name="lastName::Smith"
></div>
```

```json
{
  "FirstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith"
}
```

**Note: You can use `data-dv-param` in conjunction with a `data-parameter-factory` callback function. The callback function is given priority over the `data-dv-param` attributes if any duplicate properties are encountered.**

## Continue Tokens<a name="continue-tokens"></a>

Continue tokens are handled out of the box in BXI, bxi-davinci will attempt to continue the flow in the same container where they were originally launched from. If you redirect to a different page within BXI from the 'Appication Return To URL' field in your connector, make sure to add a static or modal element on the new page with the same data-policy-id attribute for the continueToken logic to hook onto.

## Access and ID Tokens<a name="tokens"></a>

If you would like to get access or id tokens from within your own JavaScript, you can do so with the `bxi.getIdToken()` and `bxi.getAccessToken()` functions. These will only work if the user has been authentication and the functions are called after the bxi initialization code has been run. Under the hood these are stored in sessionStorage in `bxi_accessToken` and `bxi_idToken`.

## Debugging<a name="debugging"></a>

You can set `"debugLogging": true` in `config/bxi.json` at the base of your project to see advanced debugging output. There will be additional logging both in the server terminal and in your browser (server-side logging requires a restart to take effect since it's only read at startup).

# Installation<a name="installation"></a>

Since Glitch announced it was shutting down in July 2025 normal usage includes running it locally. We recommend setting up the project through the cloning button on the main production site for easy `config/bxi.json` setup.

## Local Set Up<a name="local-set-up"></a>

Required software:

- Git (Recommended, alternatively you can download the repository zip file)
- NodeJS (see `.nvmrc` at the root of the project for the officially supported version, other versions may work fine)
- Code Editor (such as Visual Studio Code)

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Technical-Enablement-PingIdentity/BXIndustry-Handlebars.git # or download the zip file from the repository and unzip it to the location of your choosing
cd BXIndustry-Handlebars
npm install
# Generate config/bxi.json file
npm run dev
```

Once you have downloaded the repo, create a `config/bxi.json` file in the root of the repo and paste in the contents of the textarea on the final screen of the cloning flow. Alternatively you can copy `config/bxi.oidc.json` or `config/bxi.widget.json` as a starting point and update the values to point to your PingOne environment.

## Environment<a name="environment"></a>

To start BXIndustry, you must have a `config/bxi.json` file at the root of the project with the following fields:

```json
{
  "activeVertical": "", // vertical you will be redirected to when you hit the root page (e.g., https://127.0.0.1/) see Cloning section for options
  "enableEditing": false, // Optional, setting to true will enable the drawer for editing settings.json files as well as the /admin page
  "debugLogging": false, // Optional, setting to true will output additional information in the server and browser console (requires a server restart to take effect)
  "hideShortcuts": false, // Optional, setting to true will hide the gear icon that navigates to the shortcuts page
  "showCloneButton": false, // Optional, setting to true will show a floating "Clone BXIndustry" button
  "authnMethod": "widget", // "widget" (DaVinci widget flows) or "oidc" (PingOne OIDC redirect) - controls the Log In/Sign Up buttons
  "widget": {
    "apiUrl": "", // Default hostname used by davinci.js for running flows
    "dvJsUrl": "", // Default location where davinci.js should be loaded from, this should be the full URL
    "sdkTokenUrl": "", // Default hostname to use for retrieving a DV Token for running your flows
    "apiKey": "", // DaVinci API Key used for running all flows in your clone - see note below, this is usually left blank here
    "companyId": "", // Default Company ID used for running all flows in your clone
    "dashboardPolicyId": "", // Policy ID used on all dashboard pages to load a static widget
    "genericPolicyId": "", // Only used on the generic vertical, static widget that is loaded on page load
    "clonePolicyId": "", // Policy ID used by the floating "Clone BXIndustry" button (see showCloneButton)
    "cloneEnvironment": "", // Optional parameter passed along to the clone flow
    "authnButtons": [
      // Array of { label, policyId } rendered as Log In/Sign Up buttons in the home page nav (only when authnMethod is "widget")
      { "label": "Log In", "policyId": "" },
      { "label": "Sign Up", "policyId": "" }
    ],
    "dashboardTabs": [
      // Array of { label, policyId } rendered as buttons on every vertical's dashboard page
      { "label": "Update Profile", "policyId": "" },
      { "label": "Reset Password", "policyId": "" },
      { "label": "Manage Devices", "policyId": "" }
    ]
  },
  "oidc": {
    "redirectIssuer": "", // Required if authnMethod is "oidc", the issuer URL for your OIDC provider
    "redirectClientId": "" // Required if authnMethod is "oidc", the client ID for your OIDC provider
  }
}
```

Note that `widget.*` fields other than `authnButtons` are used regardless of `authnMethod` - the clone button, dashboard widget, generic vertical's widget, and `dashboardTabs` buttons all run through the DaVinci widget even when login/registration happen via OIDC.

**A note on `widget.apiKey`:** unlike the rest of `config/bxi.json`, this file is meant to be safe to commit to source control, so the DaVinci API key is not stored here. If `widget.apiKey` is blank (or missing) in `config/bxi.json`, the server falls back to a `BXI_API_KEY` value in a `.env` file at the root of the project (create one if it doesn't exist - `.env` is gitignored). You can also still set `widget.apiKey` directly from the `/admin` page - doing so writes the value to `.env` instead of `config/bxi.json` for the same reason, and (unlike the rest of `config/bxi.json`) requires a server restart to take effect, since `.env` is only read once at startup.

**Note: Changes to `config/bxi.json` take effect immediately (no restart required), with the exception of `debugLogging`, which is only read once at server startup.**
